Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide

Airbnb React/JSX style Guide

This project is written and maintained in Typescript, so typescript rules must be followed. We are using ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and proper styling.

This project is configured to automatically format code on paste and on save in VS Code, as well as code highligting based on configured rules using extentions mentioned earlier.

You may manually check code quality and apply fixes by running the following commands.

# To check formatting issues, run
yarn prettier

# To fix formatting issues, run
yarn prettier:fix

# To check linting issues, run
yarn lint

# To fix linting issues, run
yarn lint:fix
